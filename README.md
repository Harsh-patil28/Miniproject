# 4-bit Carry Select Adder using CMOS 180nm Technology

This project is dedicated to the realization of Power efficent 4-bit carry Select Adder (CSA). The design and simulations are conducted utilizing Cadence Virtuoso software, a robust platform known for its efficacy in electronic design automation. The implementation employs 180nm Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology, chosen for its optimal performance characteristics. Simulation and transient analysis are seamlessly executed using the Cadence Analog Design Environment (ADE), ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the 4-bit CSA functionality and performance attributes. This repository serves as a repository for the development, and documentation.
